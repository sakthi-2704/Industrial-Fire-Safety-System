Microcontroller based Industrial Applications.
Title: Industrial Fire Safety System.

Problem Statement: 
In many industrial environments, fire and smoke incidents can lead to severe property damage, operational downtime, and life-threatening situations if not detected early. Traditional safety systems often lack real-time responsiveness or affordability for small-to-medium setups. This project aims to develop a low-cost, Arduino-based Industrial Fire Safety System using flame and smoke sensors to detect hazards and trigger immediate alerts through a buzzer and LED indicator, ensuring timely awareness and response to potential fire risks.

Scope of Solution: 
The Industrial Fire Safety System is a compact and low-cost prototype designed to demonstrate the feasibility of real-time hazard detection using microcontrollers and sensors. The project focuses on detecting flame and smoke presence in an environment and providing immediate audible and visual alerts to ensure early warning.

Solution Approach: 
This was done in 2 methods, via both hardware and software. For software simulation, TinkerCAD was used. For hardware execution, Arduino IDE was used.
