# Industrial-Fire-Safety-System

## Aim: 
To design and simulate an Industrial Fire Safety System using Arduino, capable of detecting fire and harmful smoke levels through flame and gas sensors, and triggering an alert mechanism (buzzer) to ensure safety and rapid response in industrial environments.


## Project Demo

A working demonstration of the Industrial Fire Safety System is available here:

The videos show:
- Sensor inputs (flame and smoke)
- Triggering of the buzzer
- Real-time simulation using Tinkercad / physical hardware

## Result:
The system was successfully implemented using Tinkercad simulation and designed using EasyEDA for PCB layout. The flame and smoke sensors effectively detected critical thresholds, triggering a buzzer to simulate an alert. The project demonstrates a low-cost, real-time fire safety solution suitable for industrial applications.
